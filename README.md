# Eleven months of Brooklyn_Bridge pedestrian crossings

An interactive data visualization project for Introduction to Data Visualization (COMS W 4995 006) taught by Agnes Chang at Columbia University. 

The goal of this project was the visualize and allow users to index roughly 7300 data points of Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian crossing data. 

Class guidelines required most of the project to be completed in Observable. While some early data cleaning work was done using Github version control, the bulk of the project was completed and recorded on Observable.
